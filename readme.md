## Summary

This is just some code I wrote while going through the Princeton Algorithms course by Robert Sedgewick. The course is written in java, but all my code is written in c++. 


## Interesting Examples
- Week1/UnionFindTests -> analyzes the running time of various union find algorithms given user inputted size

- Week1/Assignment1 -> runs a percolation test in Log(n) time on an MxN matrix (user-provided) to assess how many random boxes need to be filled to determine whether the top row and bottom row are connected.
